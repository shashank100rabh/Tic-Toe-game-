Debian Bookworm, the current stable distribution of Debian, is a great operating system for many users. However, it does have some disadvantages, which are as follows:

It uses more RAM than previous versions of Debian. This is due to the newer kernel and other system components. If you are running on a low-memory system, you may experience performance problems.
There are some software issues. Some software packages have not been updated for Debian Bookworm yet, and may not work properly.
It is a new release, so there may be bugs. As with any new software, there is always the possibility of bugs. These bugs should be fixed over time, but it is something to be aware of.
Overall, Debian Bookworm is a great operating system, but it is important to be aware of its disadvantages before you install it. If you are running on a low-memory system or need to use specific software packages, you may want to wait until the software issues are resolved.

Here are some additional disadvantages that were mentioned in the LowEndTalk forum thread:

The inability to uninstall the perl-modules package.
Python seems to have some issues.
These issues are likely to be fixed in future releases of Debian Bookworm. However, it is important to be aware of them if you are considering installing the operating system.

I hope this helps!
